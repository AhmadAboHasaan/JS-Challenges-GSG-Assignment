# JavaScript Challenges – GSG Assignment

To the reviewer who holds the next door open — **one short story before you skim through the code.**

Last year, when every checkpoint around Gaza felt like a full stop, I decided to write my own commas. Electricity was rationed, the border was sealed, and YouTube playlists became my only campus. From one charging spot to the next Wi‑Fi spot, I kept chasing kilowatts and kilobits — not because circumstances were kind, but because excuses weren’t welcome in my vocabulary. **This repository is the results journal of that sprint.**

وبرضو حابب أوضح أنني مسجل حالياً مساق **تدريب ميداني** في الفصل الدراسي الحالي في **الجامعة الإسلامية**، وقبولكم لي سيكون مساهمة قيّمة تُعينني على إكمال متطلبات هذا المساق.
